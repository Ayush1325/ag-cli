# Angular Dart CLI

Just a python based CLI for Anular Dart 5 as I wasn't able to find any. It can currently only generate Angular Dart 5 apps.

## Requirements:-

Dart 2 or above
Python 3.5 or above

## Install Instuctions:-

Run the install.sh script for install in dev mode.

```
sh install.sh
```

To install in normal mode replace the contents of install script with the one below.

```
pip3 install .
```

## Usage:-

To create Application:

```
ad app -n APP_NAME
```

To create Component:

```
ad comp -n COMPONENT_NAME
```

To build app:

```
ad build
```

To serve app:

```
ad serve
```

For more information:

```
ad -h
```

## Sill in alpha. Now full apps can be generated.
