# Angular Dart CLI

Just a python based CLI for Anular Dart 5 as I wasn't able to find any.

## Install Instuctions:-

Run the install.sh script for install in dev mode.

```
sh install.sh
```

To install in normal mode replace the contents of install script with the one below.

```
pip3 install .
```

## Sill in alpha. Only blank components file can be generated.
